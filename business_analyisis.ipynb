We believe this high content, low insight process is a core driver of inefficiency in the industry. Maven is building the platform that will allow stakeholders of all disciplines to effectively evaluate therapeutic opportunities. \\r\\n\\r\\n169 Drugs each year fail in clinical development due to business and commercial reasons (only ~60 drugs are approved annually). That number represents roughly 20% of all clinical development programs, or roughly $28 billion in sub-optimal R&D dollars annually. At Maven Bio, our goal is to halve the commercial failure rate and thereby increase the number of drugs that are approved and available to patients. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo start, Maven is building a biopharma commercial intelligence platform which allows corporate development teams to rapidly construct deal landscapes and conduct comparative analyses. Maven empowers users with evidence-backed insights based on their business context. Over time, Maven will add additional knowledge areas to the platform to provide an increasingly comprehensive and accurate assessment of a therapeutic opportunity.generative-aibiotechhealthcareenterprisehealthcare-it\\n\\nMathGPT Pro (w2024)\\xa0•\\xa0Active\\xa0•\\xa07 employees\\xa0•\\xa0Santa Clara, CA, USAMathGPT Pro is the leading AI math solver that enhances both student learning and teacher productivity.
